Need of file permissions
  => Just like other operating systems, Linux also protects resources with a set of permissions.
  => These permissions define how a user should access the resources.
  => A user is anyone who accesses the resource such as user account, system process or application.
  => A resource is an object accessed by user such as file or directory.
  => Each object has three levels of permissions; user owner permissions, group owner permissions and other permissions. These permissions define how user, group and others can access that object respectively.

     (Note: A group is a set of users)

Lets’ try to understand the different permission levels:

   =>  User owner is the user who created that object or designated as user owner by actual owner or root (admin) user.
   =>  Group owner is the primary group of user owner or designated group by actual owner or root user.
   => All remaining users and groups are considered as others.



   =============================
permission:- 
---     ---     ---
rwx     rwx     rwx
user    group   other

Read, write, execute and –
The ‘r’ means you can “read” the file’s contents. 
The ‘w’ means you can “write”, or modify, the file’s contents. 
The ‘x’ means you can “execute” the file. This permission is given only if the file is a program. 
If any of the “rwx” characters is replaced by a ‘-‘, then that permission has been revoked. 



=================
 decode permission:-
 -rw-r--r--
at 1st position
{-}:- indicate file
{d}:- indicate directory
{l}:- indicate a link

at 2nd to 4th position
r:- read permission to the owner
w:- write permission to the owner
x:- execute permission to the owner

at 5th to 7th position
r-- :- for member of the group owning the file
at 8th to 10th position
r-- :-  for other user

now to add any access mode to the file we use
chmod +x <filename>
chmod +rwx <filename>
chmod -wx <filename> 
Above methode work only for owner of the file

in case of group ans user we use 'g' ans 'o'
chmod g+w <filename>
chmod o-rw <filename>

Note:-
chmod ugo+rwx foldername to give read, write, and execute to everyone.
chmod a=r foldername to give only read permission for everyone.


==========================
File permission using digits

4 :- read permission
2 :- write permisiion
1 :- execute permission 

‘0’ represents no permission. For example:


chmod 777 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for everyone.
chmod 700 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for the user only.
chmod 327 foldername will give write and execute (3) permission for the user, w (2) for the group, and read, write, and execute for the users.
