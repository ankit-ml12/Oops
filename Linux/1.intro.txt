What is an operating system?
An operating system is the most critical software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes and all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. It makes it easier to interact with computers such as going through files and folders, configuring settings, connecting to the network, etc. Windows is a commonly used operating system. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. Watch the video below to learn more about operating systems.


What are Linux operating systems?

Why linux:- 
The Terminal, also known as the command line or a Terminal emulator, is an essential component of any useful operating system. It is by far one of the most important applications on Mac and Linux. The Terminal provides an efficient interface to access the true power of a computer better than any graphical interface.
