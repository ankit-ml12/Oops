Can our system support GTA 5?
The minimum system requirement for running GTA 5 (Grand Theft Auto, which is a video game) are

CPU - 2500 MHz 
RAM - 4GB
Free Disk Space - 65GB

===============

Let’s check if our system can support GTA 5. Fingers crossed!

How would you check the clock speed of a processor?

/proc/cpuinfo file
  => Linux stores CPU related information in the /proc/cpuinfo file.
  => You can view its content using cat command.
  => You’ll be able to see the clock speed listed as the “cpu MHz” attribute.
  =>  There can be more than one “cpu MHz” entry if the processor is multi-core.
  ===============================
/proc/meminfo file
  => This file stores memory related information.
      => MemTotal - total memory available
      => MemFree - amount of free memory
  => You can view the information using cat command.

==========================
free command gives a quick summary of the memory usage.

========================
Similar to ls -h, free -h prints the memory usage in human-readable format like KB, MB, GB etc.
=========================
vmstat command can be used to display the memory usage along with additional information about io and cpu usage. This command is a part of sysstat package which needs to be installed using any package managers like apt.
=========================

Activity
Print out just the value of the MemFree attribute which denotes the amount of free memory. 
==========================
Note
1. Filter for the line in /proc/meminfo containing the attribute MemFree
2. Fetch the numerical value and “kB” in that line

===========================
df command
This command is used to see the storage usage by different file system directories 
==============================
du command
=> What if we wanted to view disk usage at directory level?
 1. The du command prints disk usage information for directories
     1. It lists the storage occupied by each of its directories and at the end shows the total size of the directory
 2. du -a shows size of files as well
 3. du -s shows size of just the total size of the directory
