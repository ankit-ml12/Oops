Manipulating files and directories

1. mkdir
The command mkdir stands for “make directory”.
It creates each directory specified as an argument in the order given.

Instead of creating the missing parent directories one by one, invoke the mkdir command with the -p option. When 
the -p option is used, the command creates the directory only if it doesn’t exist.


2. tree
You need to use a command called tree.

It will list the contents of directories in a tree-like format.
It is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files.
When directory arguments are given, the tree lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found, the tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.


3. touch
It is used to create a file without any content
The file created using touch command will be empty
This command can be used when we do not have data to store at the time of file creation
ex:- touch ankit.txt 

4. 4. cp
This command is used to copy the contents of a file (i.e source) to another file in the same or different directory(i.e, destination)

A new file automatically gets created in the destination directory to store the copied content if a file of the same name does not exist already.

B. If the destination folder already contains a file with the same name, its content gets overwritten

cp <source-path> <destination-path>

5. cat command is used to print the content of file 

6.Copy pasting directory
