Viewing file contents
Looking at the contents of a file is essential. Given that we’ll have very long files, our requirement could be to check the last few lines of a file, etc; there are different ways to print the contents of a file

1. cat
cat command is very frequently used in Linux
It reads data from a file and prints its content on the terminal
It helps us to view files
-n options prints the content along with line numbers

2. head
head command prints 10 lines from top (head) of a file
We can use the -n option to configure how many lines to print
 ex:- head -n 10 ankit.txt 

3. tail
tail command prints 10 lines from end (tail) of a file
We can use the -n option to configure how many lines to print

The -f option can be used to listen to changes to a file
this cmd work only with tail cmd 
Ctrl + c can be used to exit out of the tail interactive window when listening to a file


4. more
more allows to view contents of a large file part by part instead of printing a long file entirely on the terminal
We can navigate the more output using these keys on the keyboard

    :- “space” key - Go to next page
    :- “b” key - Go back one page
    :- “Enter” key - Show next line of content

5. less
less functions similar to more but is efficiently implemented to not load the entire content of a file to memory all at once.


We can navigate the less output using these keys on the keyboard

:- “space” key - Go to next page
:- “b” key - Go back one page
:- “Enter” key - Show next line of content
:- “y” key - Show previous line of content
:- “q” key - Get outside of the less screen
