Absolute path
Absolute path
In the Linux terminal, there is always more than one way to do the same thing. Below are some options to display the contents of /var.

cd to the /var directory and do ls
Do ls /var instead


This is called using the absolute path where we provided the full path to a directory right from the root of the filesystem: /.


======================
To make it explicit a path is a directory, it’s common to add an additional / at the end of the paths.

1. Eg: /var/ is same as the /var directory
2. Both ls /var and ls /var/ will list the contents of the /var directory
3. You’ll get a below error if you append / to a non-directory



======================================
Relative Path
Let’s look back into this example where we are already inside the /home/crio-user/workspace/ directory and want to cd to the /home/crio-user/workspace/linux-commands directory. 


You’d notice the cd linux-commands command not starting with the / character. This is called a Relative path.



Relative paths are relative to the present working directory

Note
Let’s look at some common terminologies

1. Current or Present working directory : As the name indicates, it represents the current directory in which we are currently working.
2. Parent directory: This represents the directory which contains the present directory.
   2.1 Suppose the folder structure is like, we have a directory named “children/” inside which we have directories named “child1/” and “child2/”
   2.2 Let’s say we are currently working in the “child2/” directory. In this case, parent directory is the “children/” directory.
3. Previous working directory: Suppose if we take example of previous file structure. If we start working with the “child1/” directory and then we cd to “child2/” directory, then previous working directory will be “child1”
