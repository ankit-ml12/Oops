Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Charactersticks of OOPs:-
1. Object
2. class
3. abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance.

Object:- 
 
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. 


Class:- A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
class is a templet which define property and function of object.


let suppose student is object then it has property like 
name, rollno, age, address.
ans function like
change age(), change address();
